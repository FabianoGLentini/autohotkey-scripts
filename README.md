# AutoHotkey Scripts

A personal collection of AutoHotkey scripts to automate workflows, speed up typing, and enhance productivity across Windows devices. This repo is organized into modular directories, making it easy to expand, update, and reuse across machines.

## üìÅ Script Categories

| Category | Folder  | Description                                  |
| -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Math     | `math/` | Toggleable hotstrings for math/logic symbols |

## How It Works

Each script is written in [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and can be run independently by double-clicking the `.ahk` file. Scripts are grouped by purpose in their respective directories.

## Getting Started

1. **Install AutoHotkey**

   - [Download here](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

2. **Clone this Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FabianoGLentini/autohotkey-scripts.git
   ```

3. **Run a Script**

   - Navigate to any folder and double-click the `.ahk` file you want to use.

## üîÑ Sync Across Devices
